            Sing no sad songs for me; 
            Plant thou no roses at my head, 
            Nor shady cypress tree: 
            Be the green grass above me

                "A thousand times we needed you. 
                A thousand times we cried. 
                If love alone could have saved you, 
                you never would have died. 
                A heart of gold stopped beating; 
                two twinkling eyes closed to rest. 
                God our hearts to prove he only took the best; 
                never a day goes by that you're not in my heart and my soul.
