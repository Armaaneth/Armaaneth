        "When I am dead, my dearest, <br>
        Sing no sad songs for me; <br>
        Plant thou no roses at my head, <br>
        Nor shady cypress tree: <br>
        Be the green grass above me <br>
        With showers and dewdrops wet; <br><br>

        "A thousand times we needed you. <br>
        A thousand times we cried. <br>
        If love alone could have saved you, <br>
        you never would have died. <br>
        A heart of gold stopped beating; <br>
        two twinkling eyes closed to rest. <br>
        God broke our hearts to prove he only took the best; <br>
        never a day goes by that you're not in my heart and my soul. <br> <br>
